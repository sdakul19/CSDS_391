# Test file to test functionality of the 8 Puzzle Commands

# Initial state is
# | |1|2|
# |3|4|5|
# |6|7|8|

# First set of commands test invalid movement commands ie. moving the blank space
# in a direction it can't move
# Any time the blank space is in the top row, it can't move up
# Any time the blank space is in the bottom row, it can't move down
# Any time the blank space is on the right side, it can't move right
# Any time the blank space is on the left side, it can't move left

# Should be invalid because the blank space is at position 0
move up

# 3rd move to the right should be invalid and any move up should be invalid
move right

# Test invalid set state commands
# A valid setState command has unique number 0-8 and exactly 9 numbers
# Any duplicates, or set of numbers outside of 0-8 will result in an invalid command
setState
setState 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
setState 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7
setState 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 9
setState 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

# Test set state back to original start

# Test print state
# Print state is built into the cmdfile command but can also be used in the text file

# Test reset
# Reset is used to bring the puzzle back to the original structure
reset

# Test scramble state
# Reset is used internally in scrambleState
# If no scramble number n is stated, no random movements will occur

# Set the seed for the scramble using setSeed
